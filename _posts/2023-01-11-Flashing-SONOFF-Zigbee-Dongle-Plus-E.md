I was able to succesfully flash [SonOff Zigbee dongle plus E](https://sonoff.tech/product/gateway-and-sensors/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus-e/){:target="_blank"} and curating all the steps below.

#### Why you might need to flash firmware:
- upgrade
- to use a different (opensource) option
- convert a Zigbee coordinator into a Zigbee router (this was my use case)


Apparently, the [SonOff Zigbee dongle plus E](https://sonoff.tech/product/gateway-and-sensors/sonoff-zigbee-3-0-usb-dongle-plus-e/){:target="_blank"} acts as a very good router.













#### What is Zigbee
Zigbee is a wireless communication standard used for the creation of personal area networks (PANs) with low-power digital radios, such as those used in home automation, medical device data collection, and other low-power IoT devices.
It operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band and is designed to be a low-cost, low-power, and secure mesh networking solution.

Zigbee Coordinator:
In a Zigbee network, the Zigbee coordinator is the device responsible for establishing and maintaining the network. It acts as the central hub, creating the initial network and managing network parameters, such as security keys, network address assignment,
and network topology.

Zigbee Router:
Zigbee router is a device that serves as an intermediary between the coordinator and other devices on the network. Routers help extend the range of the network by forwarding messages and data between devices, and also help to reduce the workload
on the coordinator by allowing it to manage fewer devices directly.
